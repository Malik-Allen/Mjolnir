# Mjolnir
A reliable and performant math library.

## Goals
- To explore and review math concepts traditionally used in game and simulation development. 
- Develop a high-performance math library, that can be used in renderers, games and simulation engines.

## Practical Outcomes
These are the outcomes that I want from this library:
- Vector Math
- Matrix Math
- Quaternion Math
- Linear Representations (Curves)
- Geometry
	- Ray
	- Planes
	- Sphere
	- Frustum
	- etc.
- Geomteric Testsing
	- Closest Point
	- Intersections
- Random Number Generator
	- Noise Generation
	- Seeding
	- etc.
- A go to resource for math
